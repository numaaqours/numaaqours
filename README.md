# 👋 Hey, I'm numaaqours!

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a member of [WitAqua](https://github.com/WitAqua) as a designer –  
mainly responsible for making things look nice (like our custom boot animations 🔥).  
While I don’t really write code myself, I occasionally dive into building custom Android ROMs  
just for fun, especially for:

- 📱 Pixel 6a (`bluejay`)  
- 📱 arrows We2 (`itc`)

## 🎨 What I do

- 👾 Designer @ WitAqua  
  (Yes, I made the boot animation we use 👀)

- 🔧 Casual ROM builder  
  I like building LineageOS-based ROMs now and then.

- 🍎 Sometimes playing around with iOS jailbreak stuff.

- 🐧 Dabble in Linux things just for fun (servers, WSL2, etc.)

## ❓ Can I code?

Not really... 😅  
But I love being part of the scene and supporting projects however I can!

## 📝 About this README

I was too lazy to write this myself,  
so I asked ChatGPT to come up with something cool.  
(And honestly? Not bad, right?)

Thanks for stopping by!
